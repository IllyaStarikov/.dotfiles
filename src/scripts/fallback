fallback - Execute the first available command from a list

Usage: 
  fallback [-v|--verbose] [-h|--help] command1 command2 ...

Options:
  -v, --verbose    Show verbose output (which commands are being tried)
  -h, --help       Show this help message

Examples:
  # Try to run claude, fall back to codex, then gemini
  fallback claude codex gemini

  # Same but with verbose output
  fallback -v claude codex gemini

  # Pass arguments to the command that runs
  fallback nvim vim vi -- file.txt

Description:
  Tries each command in order until one is found in PATH and executes it.
  By default, runs silently unless all commands fail.
  
  Use -- to separate fallback commands from arguments to pass to the
  command that eventually runs.

Exit codes:
  0 - A command was found and executed successfully
  1 - No commands were found in PATH
  Other - Exit code from the executed command
