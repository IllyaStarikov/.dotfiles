# .dotfiles

All of my frequently used dotfiles, including:

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org) config (vimrc)
- [Z-Shell](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) config (zhsrc)
- [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) profile (as JSON)

Currently, I am using [neovim](https://neovim.io). My package manager of choice is [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), so after installation, run `PlugInstall`. Although *all* the commands aren't portable, it should work fine.

My zsh setup is managed by oh-my-zsh. Aliases are also in zshrc.

iTerm is a great alternative to macOS Terminal.app, so I use that. The profile is a JSON export of my profile settings; to import `Preferences -> General -> Load preferences from a custom folder or URL`.
