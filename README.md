# .dotfiles

All of my frequently used dotfiles, including:

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org) config (vimrc)
- [Z-Shell](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) config (zhsrc)
- [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) profile (as JSON)

Although I use MacVim (yes, I use `mvim`), the config should work fine for vanilla Vim. The package manager used is [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim); after installation run `PluginInstall`.

My zsh setup is managed by oh-my-zsh. Aliases are also in zshrc.

iTerm is a great alternative to macOS Terminal.app, so I use that. The profile is a JSON export of my profile settings; to import `Preferences -> General -> Load preferences from a custom folder or URL`.
