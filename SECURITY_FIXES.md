# Security and Performance Fixes Applied

This document summarizes all the security vulnerabilities fixed and performance optimizations applied based on the comprehensive code review.

## Security Fixes

### 1. Command Injection Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)

**Zsh Functions** (src/zshrc):
- Fixed `ff()` function - added pattern escaping
- Fixed `grep_smart()` function - added `--` separator
- Added proper input validation for all shell functions

**Shell Scripts**:
- `update` script - added package name validation with regex
- `format` script - replaced unsafe glob expansion with `find`
- Added path validation to prevent directory traversal

### 2. Arbitrary Code Execution (CRITICAL)

**Private Config Loading** (src/zshrc):
- Implemented allowlist for sourced files
- Added ownership and permission checks (600/644 only)
- Validate files before sourcing

### 3. Remote Code Execution (CRITICAL)

**Setup Scripts** (src/setup/mac.sh):
- Download scripts to temp files before execution
- Basic content verification for Homebrew, Oh My Zsh, and Rust
- Verify expected content before running

### 4. Dangerous Aliases

**Aliases** (src/zsh/aliases.zsh):
- Replaced `cleanup` alias with function requiring confirmation
- Replaced `emptytrash` alias with function requiring "yes" confirmation
- Removed `grep=rg` alias that could break scripts

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Shell Startup Time

**Zsh** (src/zshrc):
- Reduced Oh My Zsh plugins from 16 to 6 essential ones
- Minimized Spaceship prompt sections
- Disabled non-essential prompt features

### 2. Resource Usage

**Tmux** (src/tmux.conf):
- Reduced history limit: 50K → 10K lines
- Increased status refresh interval: 5s → 15s

**Alacritty** (src/alacritty.toml):
- Set opacity to 1.0 (removed transparency overhead)
- Reduced scrollback: 100K → 10K lines
- Reduced font size: 18 → 16

**Git** (src/gitconfig):
- Reduced memory allocations: 2GB → 512MB-1GB
- More reasonable pack settings

### 3. Neovim

**Simplified** (src/init.lua):
- Removed complex verbose logging logic
- Better error handling with notifications

## Feature Additions

### 1. Alacritty VI Mode
- Added complete VI mode configuration
- VI-style search bindings
- Better navigation keybindings

### 2. Git Commit Template
- Created structured commit message template
- Enabled in gitconfig
- Added to symlink setup

### 3. Better Error Handling
- All scripts now use proper error codes
- Input validation throughout
- Clear error messages

## Breaking Changes

1. **Private configs** now require proper ownership/permissions
2. `cleanup` and `emptytrash` now require confirmation
3. `grep` no longer aliased to `rg` by default
4. Git URL rewriting removed (was forcing SSH for GitHub)

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Add CI/CD** for dotfiles to catch issues early
2. **Implement tests** for shell functions
3. **Use shellcheck** in pre-commit hooks
4. **Consider migration** to more modern tools:
   - fish/nushell instead of zsh
   - wezterm instead of alacritty
   - gitui instead of lazygit
5. **Add logging** for debugging issues
6. **Document** all custom functions

## Summary

All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed. The configuration is now:
- More secure against command injection
- Protected from arbitrary code execution
- Safer with remote script downloads
- Optimized for better performance
- More maintainable with better practices
